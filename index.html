        <h3 class="title-history">History of the Game</h3>
        <p class="p">This story follows a young witch named Suni, whose life takes a tragic turn when she loses her entire family to a mysterious illness, leaving her an orphan. Stricken with grief and alone, she is taken in by the kind residents of Lunaris, a peaceful town inhabited by magical beings of all kinds. In Lunaris, Suni finds a new sense of belonging, as the town was known for its harmony, happiness, and the bonds between its people.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="p">However, their peaceful existence is shattered when a dark force begins to corrupt the town’s once-protective wolves, turning them from guardians into sinister foes. As the wolves succumb to this power, they grow hostile, and the town’s resources begin to dwindle. Food, materials, and medicine become scarce as the wolves hoard everything for themselves, leaving Lunaris on the brink of ruin.</p>
        <br >
        <p class="p">Desperate to save the only home she has left and the friends who have become her new family, Suni decides to embark on a perilous journey. Armed with her magical powers and unyielding determination, she ventures beyond Lunaris to seek a way to break the corruption’s hold over the wolves. Along the way, she encounters powerful beings, dangerous challenges, and discovers untapped depths of her own magic. With time running out, Suni must harness her full potential to defeat the corrupted wolves and restore balance to Lunaris, not just to protect her friends but to ensure she doesn’t lose everything dear to her once again.</p>
